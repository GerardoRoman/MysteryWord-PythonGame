1. Open file, read it, make it into a list of words. Words in the file are separated by newlines.

2. Select a random word

3. Show number of letters in word

4. Ask user to guess
    - keep a count of wrong guesses and the actual wrong letters that were guessed
        - if the guess is wrong, tell the user that it's wrong
    - keep track of correct letter guesses
    - if a guess is correct, display it like this âœ…
        B _ _ B A _ D
    - if the letter has already been guess, tell the user and don't take away a guess

5. Repeat step 4 until user reaches 8 guesses or they guess all the letters in the word correctly
    - If user reaches 8 wrong guesses, break and tell them they are out of guesses and reveal the word
    - If user guesses the word, tell them they are right and reveal the word

6. Ask if they want to play again. If so, go back to step 2
